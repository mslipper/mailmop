# MailMop

MailMop cleans out your inbox by grouping junk e-mails and deleting them in bulk.

## Features

### Does One Thing Well

It deletes e-mails. In bulk. That's it.

### Keeps Your E-Mails Private

Your data never leaves your desktop. We can't - nor will we ever - see the content or the metadata of your e-mails.

### Fast and Lightweight

If you have Java installed, the whole app is just 700kb. When you're done with it, just delete it.

### Completely Free

There is no premium plan. No upselling. No annoying pop-ups. Just pure satisfaction, as you watch gigabytes of useless e-mails disappear from your inbox.

If you want to support MailMop's development, either submit a patch or send me Bitcoin at `1PsHpFP9bMbaDNEk8QYq3UNUcWVNSVUDzX`.

## Installation

Download and run the installer - that's it!

If you want to compile the application from source, you can do that too. Simply run `mvn clean install` in the root directory of the project, and run the outputted `jar` file.

## FAQs

### 1. Why did you build this?

I logged into GMail one day and saw that I accumulated over 70,000 total e-mails. The vast majority of them were worthless. LinkedIn pinged me over 2,000 times. Some furniture store called Dot & Bo pinged me 300 times. There were many other offenders. As much as I love hearing about how people in my extended network think LinkedIn is too much like Facebook now and getting the hottest deals on modern throw pillows, the cognitive load of all those messages was too much. So, I built a CLI tool to nuke them from orbit then built a UI to nuke them from orbit more delightfully. Then I open sourced everything.

### 2. Who are you?

I'm [Matthew Slipper](https://www.matthewslipper.com). I write software. Sometimes I blog.

### 3. How do you make money from this?

I don't. It's a labor of love. My inbox is so clean, I care about every message in it. I want other people to experience that same feeling of e-mail freedom.

### 4. What's MailMop's roadmap?

I want to add an automatic unsubscribe feature in the future. This *will* happen at some point. Unroll.me, which does this already, sold people's e-mail data. That's not cool, and I want to provide an alternative that doesn't do that.
